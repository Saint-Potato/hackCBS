UI Similar to VS Code, this code is inspired from a similar tool Chat2DB (https://github.com/CodePhiliaX/Chat2DB/tree/main)

A navigation bar on the left border which can be used to select the main view. 
A panel after navigation bar which shows database tree structure like the file structure in VS code, it should show the different connections, under connections should be databases available on that connection. Under database tables.

In the main screen in middle, I want the chatbot view for now.

Make the theme dark.
